# Keylogger
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on a computer or mobile device. The term itself is short for "keystroke logger." These tools can capture a wide range of sensitive information, including passwords, credit card numbers, private messages, and web searches.

## Description
This is a simple keylogger written in Python using the `pynput` library. It captures keystrokes, timestamps them, and saves them to a log file.

## Features
- Logs individual key presses.
- Adds a timestamp to each entry.
- Cleans and formats special keys (e.g., Space, Enter, Shift).
- Saves logs to `logs/keylog.txt`.

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware that records every keystroke a user makes on a computer or mobile device. The term itself is short for "keystroke logger." These tools can capture a wide range of sensitive information, including passwords, credit card numbers, private messages, and web searches.

Keyloggers operate covertly in the background, meaning the user is typically unaware that their actions are being monitored.

How Keyloggers Work
There are two primary categories of keyloggers:

Software Keyloggers: These are programs installed on a device's hard drive. They can be introduced to a system through malicious downloads, phishing emails, or by being bundled with legitimate software. Some software keyloggers are very sophisticated, operating at the kernel (core) level of the operating system to intercept keystrokes before they reach the applications. They can then save this information in a hidden file and send it to an attacker over the internet.

Hardware Keyloggers: These are physical devices that intercept the signal between the keyboard and the computer. They can be small adapters that plug into a USB port or be embedded directly within the keyboard itself. Since they don't rely on software installed on the computer, they are much harder for antivirus programs to detect. However, they require physical access to the device to be installed.

Beyond just logging keystrokes, advanced keyloggers can also capture screenshots, record clipboard content (text you copy), and even access the device's microphone and webcam.

Uses of Keyloggers
While often associated with criminal activity, keyloggers have both legitimate and malicious applications.

Legitimate Uses
Corporate Monitoring: Companies may use keyloggers to monitor employee activity on company-owned devices to ensure compliance with policies and prevent misuse of resources.

Parental Control: Parents might use keyloggers to supervise their children's online activities for safety.

IT Troubleshooting: IT departments can use keystroke logs to diagnose technical problems on a system.

Malicious Uses
Cybercrime: The most common malicious use is to steal sensitive data for financial fraud or identity theft.

Espionage: They can be used to gather confidential information from governments or competing corporations.

Data Theft: Attackers use the captured keystrokes, especially usernames and passwords, to gain unauthorized access to secure systems and online accounts.
